1. This assignment asks us to create a client and server where the
client sends user input to the server and the server checks said
input for validity. This is to be designed as a game of hangman in
which the user has N guesses, where N is the length of the word.
The server sends the board and the client displays it to terminal
after each guess. Unique returns are to be implemented for a
win/loss and concurrent clients must be supported.
2. We anticipate the most challenging aspect of this assignment
to be debugging the program as errors could result from interactions
between the client and server and manifest in unexpected ways.
3. The three resources we plan to draw from if we get stuck are:
    1. Linux man pages
    2. TCP/IP Protocol book
    3. The professor
4. We will meet Tuesday from 2-3 and 4-7 (if necessary), Wednesday from
12-1 and 2-3, Thursday from 11-5, and Friday from 12-2.
