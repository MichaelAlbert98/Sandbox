1. This assignment asks us to create a client and server where a set of K letters
is chosen by the server and sent to two clients. Each client takes turns inputting
words that can be formed from the K letters given by the server. If an invalid
word is input, the word is a repeat, or the client is unable to find a valid
word within N seconds, then the round is over and the other client gets a point.
The server then sends a new randomly chosen set of K letters. This continues
until one client has accumulated 3 points. The programs are also required to be
able to handle disconnects, concurrent clients, and follow the protocols
specified in prog2.pdf.
2. We anticipate the hardest part of this assignment to be keeping track of the
two clients playing the game and making sure the information they both receive
is correct and that no inconsistencies arise. Following the protocols in
assignment 1 was difficult and the protocols in assignment 2 are even more
complex/numerous. We think that a large portion of our time will be spent on
simply double checking to make sure that correct data types and data values
are being sent from the client to server and vice versa.
3. The three resources we plan to draw from if we get stuck are:
    1. Linux man pages
    2. TCP/IP Protocol book
    3. The professor
4. We plan to use the implementation of a trie done by GeeksforGeeks.
5. We will meet Tuesday from 2-3, Wednesday from 12-1 and 2-3,
   Thursday from 11-5, and Friday from 12-2.
