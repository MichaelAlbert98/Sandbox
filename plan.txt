1. We will create a chat room in which up to 255 participants can communicate.
Each participant sends messages to the server who relays it to everyone/a
specified person. An observer attached to a participant displays messages
to that participant. When joining, a participant has 60 seconds to pick a unique
username; an observer needs to select an existing participant to observe within
60 seconds. Participants can send public/private messages to others in the chat.
2. We anticipate having the server respond to all messages/disconnects being sent
to it immediately being the hardest part of this assignment. Making sure the server
receives/sends the correct information from each client will likely be challenging,
and hard to debug, due to the fact that there can be 255 participants and
observers sending messages at one time.
3. The three resources we plan to draw from if we get stuck are:
    1. Linux man pages
    2. TCP/IP Protocol book
    3. The professor
