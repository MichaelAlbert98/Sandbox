1. Michael Albert and Jim Riley.
2. Everything appears to be working as of the current moment.
3. We tested our code in numerous ways. We tried giving the server a single
letter word and seeing if the client could win/lose correctly. We tested words
up to 255 characters to make sure that aspect worked correctly. We tested if
words containing characters outside the set {a,b,...,z} were rejected by the
server. We tested running the server and client from different computers, and
we tested running multiple clients on one server instance. We also sanity
checked the port numbers to make sure inputs must be reasonable.
4. The most challenging aspect was getting the server and client to correctly
send and receive the data they needed to. It was difficult to figure out how
to set up the various buffers as void *buf in order to use recv and send. In
addition to that, we experienced an odd error in which the previously stored
number of guesses would become appended to the char *buf that was to be sent
back to the server, which took us several hours to resolve.
