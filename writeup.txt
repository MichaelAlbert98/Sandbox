2. Fixed the bug.
3. We connected multiple clients to the server in order to test the programs
ability to connect multiple participants and observers to their specified sockets.
We sent messages from those participants to make sure the server was able to
handle their data correctly and sent the messages to the appropriate recipients.
After we were sure the server could read the messages we tested the error
checking for input usernames by testing incorrect characters and names longer
than 10. We also tested the observers ability to connect to participants and
receive private messages by inputting valid and invalid usernames and messages.
We tested the servers ability to handle disconnects from observers and
participants by having their terminals close at various times, watching to ensure
the server was able to accurately keep track of the active and inactive clients.
To test timeouts we just waited until the specific times to make sure the server
closed their sockets as well.
4. The most difficult part of this assignment was getting select to distinguish
which users had new information to send in and dealing with that data accordingly.
For a long time select would return immediately even when we made no changes to
on the client side. This problem took a long time to correct as we were both very
unfamiliar with the way select works. We eventually found that the problem had
something to do with where the information we read in was being read to. We also
had a lot of problems caused by each entry in our list of participants being
overwritten by subsequent new participants. Eventually we discovered this was
due to the fact our list was stored as a global variable. Initializing the list
inside main fixed that problem right up.
